Design Process – Hiring Poster:
This hiring poster was designed using Canva, combining a modern layout, bold color scheme, and clean typography to create a professional recruitment announcement.
I used visual elements, icons, and shapes to highlight the hiring roles and requirements clearly while keeping the overall design engaging and easy to read.

Steps Followed:
1. Selected a gradient background and customized the color tones for a soft, professional look.
2. Added heading elements like “We Are Hiring” using bold fonts to create visual impact.
3. Inserted icons and shapes to organize the job roles and make the poster more visually appealing.
4. Structured the requirements section using bullet points for clarity and readability.
5. Customized typography, alignment, and spacing to maintain a neat and consistent design flow.
6. Exported the final poster as a high-quality image suitable for corporate hiring posts, website uploads, and GitHub documentation.
