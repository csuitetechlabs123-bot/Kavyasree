Book cover Design Process:
This Cyber Security poster was created using Canva, combining my own layout, typography, and visual styling.
To enhance the overall look, I used a high-quality background image sourced from Google, and then customized it inside Canva with effects, overlays, and design elements to give it a modern, book-cover appearance.

Steps Followed:
1. Selected a futuristic cyber-security themed background image from Google.
2. Imported the image into Canva and applied layout adjustments, glow effects, and digital accents.
3. Designed the title and subtitle using bold, clean typography to match a book-cover style.
4. Added color enhancements, spacing adjustments, and composition refinement to give the poster a professional visual structure.
5. Exported the final design as a high-quality image suitable for book covers, presentations, and GitHub documentation.
